 INSTALL for ipmiutil source
-------------------------------------
 
The ipmiutil source package provides IPMI-based utilities and kernel 
patches for managing various servers in Linux or Windows.

The same source files can be built in both Linux and Windows as shown 
below.
 
-------------------------------------
  Build instructions for Linux 
-------------------------------------

To build with some GPL code:  
If you are building ipmiutil for open-source, then the MD2 hash 
for IPMI LAN and the valinux driver interface (/dev/ipmikcs) can 
be supported.  If so, you should specify the following during 
configure:
   "./configure --enable-gpl"
The default is to build with only BSD-licensed code and not to 
include the MD2 and valinux features.  The md2.h and ipmi_ioctl.h
files with GPL code can be removed if this option is not enabled.

To build a standalone binary without IPMI LAN 2.0 (lanplus plugin),
which may be desirable for use on bootable media (USB/CDROM), to 
decrease the size or to avoid using libcrypto, you can specify the 
following during configure:
   "./configure --disable-lanplus"
or
   "./configure --enable-standalone"
builds it without lanplus libs and without GPL code.

To add LanDesk IPMI support:
Support for the LanDesk IPMI driver requires a library supplied by 
LanDesk (libipmiapi.a).  After obtaining this library, place it in
lib/libipmiapi.a.  Then you can link ipmiutil to support it by 
specifying the following during configure:
   "./configure --enable-landesk=yes"

Steps to build for Linux:
# ./beforeconf.sh
  Which automates these functions:
   * copying libtool files
   * aclocal   (may be needed if automake versions are different)
   * autoconf  (may be needed if automake versions are different)
   * automake  
# ./configure
      --enable-landesk       adds landesk library support [default=no]
      --disable-lanplus      disable lanplus library support
      --enable-standalone    build standalone, with no GPL or LanPlus libs.
      --enable-gpl           build with some GPL code [default=no]
# make

To add the ifruset utility, which allows setting any FRU Product fields:
# cd util; make ifruset
# ifruset -?

To build and install an rpm package, use one of the following:
#  make install
#  make rpm
The make rpm produces a binary rpm, and a source rpm, which can be 
installed with "rpm -i *.rpm".

To build and install a Debian package, do this:
#  dpkg-buildpackage
then install it with "dpkg -i *.deb".

-------------------------------------
  Build instructions for Windows 
-------------------------------------

The ipmiutil Windows binaries for each release are pre-built and posted
at http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net, but here is how to build the ipmiutil 
EXEs for Windows from source.
Note that the WIN32 compile flag is used.  
The ipmiutil buildwin.cmd shows how to compile and link the lib and exe 
files, although many people prefer instead to do builds with the 
Microsoft VisualStudio project GUI.  
See also ipmiutil UserGuide section 5.2 for more details if needed.

1)  Install Visual Studio
The build environment assumes that VisualStudio 6.0 VC98 or
later is installed. 

2)  Download contrib files
Before running buildwin.cmd, first download the contributed
files for Windows (includes getopt.c and openssl).
A copy of these files is available from 
   http://ipmiutil.sf.net/FILES/ipmiutil-contrib.zip
See getopt.c from one of these
   BSD getopt.c:
     http://www.openmash.org/lxr/source/src/getopt.c?c=gsm
   public domain getopt.c:
     http://www.koders.com/c/fid034963469B932D9D87F91C86680EB08DB4DE9AA3.aspx
   GNU LGPL getopt.c:
     http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/ogg-tools/oggsplit/
See openssl from this link (Apache-style license, not gpl)
     http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.7l.tar.gz.

3)  Copy initial contrib files into ipmiutil
Below are sample directories where ipmiutil*.tar.gz was unpacked, 
and where the openssl*.tar.gz was unpacked.
> set ipmiutil_dir=c:\dev\ipmiutil
> set openssl_dir=c:\dev\openssl

First, copy the getopt.c & getopt.h into the util directory.  
From the directory where ipmiutil-contrib.zip was unpacked, 
> copy getopt.*      %ipmiutil_dir%\util
The iphlpapi.lib comes from VS 2003 .Net or Win2003 DDK.
> copy iphlpapi.lib  %ipmiutil_dir%\lib
> copy iphlpapi.h    %ipmiutil_dir%\util  

4)  Build the openssl libraries
To build from original source you would then want to build a copy of openssl 
for Windows, and copy the built openssl files to lib & inc.
Follow the openssl build instructions from INSTALL.W32 for VC++ to build 
these binaries.  Note that perl must also be installed first.

5)  Copy the resulting LIB and DLL binaries to ipmiutil
> copy %openssl_dir%\out32dll\libeay32.lib  %ipmiutil_dir%\lib
> copy %openssl_dir%\out32dll\ssleay32.lib  %ipmiutil_dir%\lib
> copy %openssl_dir%\out32dll\libeay32.dll  %ipmiutil_dir%\util
> copy %openssl_dir%\out32dll\ssleay32.dll  %ipmiutil_dir%\util
> mkdir %ipmiutil_dir%\lib\lanplus\inc\openssl
> copy %openssl_dir%\inc32\openssl\*.h %ipmiutil_dir%\lib\lanplus\inc\openssl

6)  Edit buildwin.cmd for your Visual Studio path
Edit buildwin.cmd to reflect the installed location of the VC libraries.
   Notes for VS8 (VS2005)
   set VCDIR="C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC"
    VS8 needs to add to PATH %VCDIR%\bin;
                       %VCDIR%\platformsdk\bin;
                            %VCDIR%\common7\ide;
                            %VCDIR%\common7\tools\bin
    VS8 may need CFLAG /D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE,
        VCLIB_ADD=/LIBPATH:%VCDIR%\PlatformSDK\lib
        VCINCL_ADD=%VCDIR%\PlatformSDK\include
    VS8 does not have libc.lib, use libcmt.lib instead.

7)  Run buildwin.cmd
buildwin.cmd will build all of the Windows EXE and DLL files.

If you are using ipmiutil for a bootable WinPE environment, and do not need
Serial-Over-LAN functionality, the buildwin2.cmd will build the Windows EXE 
files without using the openssl libraries, to simplify the process.  The 
openssl libraries are required for the IPMI LAN 2.0 crypto functions that
Serial-Over-LAN requires.

  the Solaris bmc driver (e.g. to HSC at 0xc0), and are sent to 
  the BMC sa instead.
- Memory mapping logic returns an error (e.g. BIOS version).
- idiscover -a broadcast ioctl works now in ipmiutil-2.3.1
