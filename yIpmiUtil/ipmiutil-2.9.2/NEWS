IPMIUTIL NEWS 

This project started in October 2001 as part of the Carrier Grade Linux effort.
It was then known as 'panicsel' ("http://panicsel.sf.net") and included a kernel patch to write a Linux panic event to the IPMI firmware log, as well as utilities.  

This code was first included in MontaVista CGE Linux 2.1 in July 2002.
The panicsel functionality was included in OSDL CGL 1.0 and 2.0 requirements.
The kernel panic functionality was included in the OpenIPMI driver for 2.6 Linux kernels, and in the Intel IMB Linux driver v28 and greater.

A Linux rpm and a Windows setup package for ipmiutil is included on 
the platform CD with Intel carrier-grade servers.

The ipmiutil (or panicsel) rpm is known to be included in the following 
Linux distributions:
MontaVista CGE 2.1, 3.0, 3.1, 4.0, SuSE SLES9, SLES10, RedFlag 5.0

See http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net for binaries, documentation, etc.

In Oct 2001 (0.8.1), started panicsel.
In Dec 2001 (1.0.0), released with Intel Telecom Linux Technology project
In July 2002 (1.2.1), released with MontaVista CGE 2.1
In Jan 2004 (1.4.1), compile flags for Windows 2000 & 2003 support were added.
In August 2004 (1.4.8), the project was moved from panicsel.sf.net to 
     ipmiutil.sf.net.  The new name more clearly reflects the purpose of the 
     project in its current state.  
In November 2004 (1.5.0), support for IPMI LAN was added using FreeIPMI.
     The FreeIPMI library includes KCS and IPMI LAN protocols.
In May 2006 (1.7.0), built-in IPMI LAN support was added.
In August 2006 (1.7.5), driverless direct I/O support was added, to no longer 
     depend upon libfreeipmi.so, since ipmilan.c and ipmidir.c replace that 
     functionality, so the utilities are now more portable.
In Jan 2007 (1.8.0), two major new features were added:
     1) The 'ipmiutil' meta-command, which may be more user-friendly for some 
        users, and maintains the existing syntax for each sub-command.  
     2) Support for IPMI LAN 2.0 RMCP+ in both Linux and Windows.  Support for 
        IPMI LAN 1.5 or 2.0 is detected by default, or can be explicitly 
        specified/forced with the -Flan2 option.
In Feb 2007 (1.9.2), Linux Serial-Over-Lan console feature was added.
In Oct 2007 (2.0.0), Windows SOL console and remote soft-shutdown features 
     were added.
In Mar 2008 (ipmiutil-2.1.0), the Windows SOL client application was completed.
In Aug 2008 (ipmiutil-2.2.0), a new function was added to save/restore the BMC 
     configuration parameters for lan, serial, user, channel, pef, and sol.  
     The command is "ipmiutil config" for this.  
In Sep 2008 (2.2.1), support for the Microsoft IPMI driver was added.
In Nov 2008 (2.3.0), support for the Sun Solaris bmc driver was added.
In Mar 2009 (2.3.5), support for the FreeBSD OS was added.
In Oct 2009 (2.5.0), added several new features:
     Full ANSI VT100 emulation for Windows SOL console
     Two-character escape sequence (~.) for SOL console, adding send-Break.
     Added canonical output option -c for fru,config,sensor,health,lan
     Added ipmiutil getevt -r to run specified script when an event occurs
In Feb 2010 (2.6.0), new subcommand naming scheme:
     Renamed subcommands to match the meta-command name plus the prefix 'i'. 
     For instance, 'showsel' is now 'isel' and 'pefconfig' is now 'ilan'.  
     This may affect some scripts that use the old subcommand shortcuts.
     Also included some spec file cleanup/standardization.
     Support added for some CG2100 firmware differences. 
In Apr 2010 (2.6.2) ifruset was added to set all FRU Product Area fields
