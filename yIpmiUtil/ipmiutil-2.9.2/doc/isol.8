.TH ISOL 8 "Version 1.1: 17 Feb 2010"
.SH NAME
ipmiutil_sol \- an IPMI Serial-Over-LAN Console application

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ipmiutil sol [-acdeilorsvwxz -NUPREFJTVY]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility starts an IPMI Serial-Over-LAN console session.
A Serial-over-LAN console allows the client to see and modify
functions before the OS boots, such as BIOS setup, grub, etc.
This utility uses either the IPMI LAN 1.5 or 2.0 SOL interface.
The 1.5 SOL interface is specific to Intel BMCs, while any IPMI 2.0
BMC should support 2.0 SOL.
The target system/node must first have these parameters configured
before SOL sessions can be started:
.br
- [BIOS] serial console redirection parameters,
.br
- [IPMI] lan and SOL parameters (see ipmiutil lan or ilan), and
.br
- [OS] For Linux, edit grub.conf, inittab, and securetty parameters.
.br
Be sure that the baud rate matches in all of the above places.
See the ipmiutil UserGuide section 4.8 for details.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-a"
Activate the SOL Console session, and enter console mode.
Use the escape sequence ('~.') to exit the session.
.IP "-c '^'"
Set the escape Character to '^', or another ANSI character.  This changes the
default two-character escape sequence ('~.') to the specified single escape
character, which will end the SOL session.
.IP "-d"
Deactivate the SOL Console session.  Use this if the previous session
was aborted abnormally and starting a new session gives an error.
.IP "-e"
Turn Encryption off in negotiation when activating a session.  By default,
encryption is on for Serial-Over-LAN console sessions.
.IP "-l"
Use Legacy BIOS mapping for Enter key (CR+LF) instead of just LF.
This is needed for BIOS Setup menus and DOS, but causes an extra LF to
occur in Linux.  So, only use this option if doing BIOS or DOS changes.
This should be seldom be needed since now the default is to automatically
detect these menus with colored backgrounds and change the mapping.
.IP "-i input_file"
Use this file as an input script.  The input_file will be read after the
session is established.  This can be used to automate certain tasks.  The
input_file is read one line at a time.  If the input_file does not
have an escape character (~) to end the session, then the input is
returned to the keyboard when the file ends.
.IP "-o output_file"
Use a Trace log.  The output_file is created and all SOL screen output is
written to the file, including VT100 escape sequences.  If the output_file
exists, the output is appended to it.  This can be used to log what the
user has done in an SOL session.
.IP "-r"
Use Raw terminal I/O instead of custom VT100 to ANSI translation (in Windows).
Use this option if the server is configured in BIOS and BMC for ANSI and
the utility is being invoked from Windows.
.IP "-s NNN"
For a slow link with high latency, this adds a delay of NNN microseconds
between sending and receiving SOL packets.  The default is 100 microseconds.
.IP "-w"
(Windows only)
Do not use the Windows Console buffer, but use Windows stdio instead.
This does not handle cursor positioning correctly in some cases, however.
.IP "-v log_file"
Causes debug messages to be displayed to the specified debug log_file.
The default log_file is isoldbg.log in the current directory.
.IP "-x"
Causes debug messages to be displayed to the debug log file.
.IP "-z"
Causes more verbose debug messages to be displayed to the debug log file.
.IP "-N nodename"
Nodename or IP address of the remote target system.  If a nodename is
specified, IPMI LAN interface is used.  Otherwise the local system
management interface is used.
.IP "-U rmt_user"
Remote username for the nodename given.  The default is a null username.
.IP "-P/-R rmt_pswd"
Remote password for the nodename given.  The default is a null password.
.IP "-E"
Use the remote password from Environment variable IPMI_PASSWORD.
.IP "-F drv_t"
Force the driver type to one of the followng:
imb, va, open, gnu, landesk, lan, lan2, lan2i, kcs, smb.
Note that lan2i means lan2 with intelplus.
The default is to detect any supported driver type and use it.
.IP "-J"
Use the specified LanPlus cipher suite (0 thru 17): 0=none/none/none,
1=sha1/none/none, 2=sha1/sha1/none, 3=sha1/sha1/cbc128, 4=sha1/sha1/xrc4_128,
5=sha1/sha1/xrc4_40, 6=md5/none/none, ... 14=md5/md5/xrc4_40.
Default is 3.
.IP "-T"
Use a specified IPMI LAN Authentication Type: 0=None, 1=MD2, 2=MD5, 4=Straight Password, 5=OEM.
.IP "-V"
Use a specified IPMI LAN privilege level. 1=Callback level, 2=User level, 3=Operator level, 4=Administrator level (default), 5=OEM level.
.IP "-Y"
Yes, do prompt the user for the IPMI LAN remote password.
Alternatives for the password are \-E or \-P.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
