HPIUTIL TODO

x Porting the utilities in hpiutil from HPI_A to HPI_B
  These can be built for either version of HPI via a compile flag.
  They default to HPI_A, since HPI_B libraries are not fully released yet.
  Ported to HPI B with OpenHPI:
    hpialarmpanel.c done, with compile flags 10/13/04
    hpireset.c, hpisensor.c, hpisel.c hpiwdt.c - done
    hpifru.c (hpifrub.c) - done
    hpievent.c (runs, but ThresholdSet error -1010 due to lib bug)
  COMPLETE

x SpiLibd supplies inventory capability for DIMMs, but gives error when
  trying to get its inventory data.  
  COMPLETE in hpiutil-1.1.9

Intel HPI library/daemon (SpiLibd) known issues:
- If the SEL is totally empty (not even a 'cleared' message), the SpiLibd
  will not start because the GetSelEntry returns 0xcb.  
  The lib probably needs to set eventid to zero and proceed in this case.

OpenHPI library/daemon with ipmidirect plugin:
  11/10/06 completed adding LEDs, watchdog, and Intel RMS features
  12/07/06 openhpi-2.6.3 released, fully tested

OpenHPI library with ipmi plugin testing & issues:
  Continuing testing of hpiutil with OpenHPI using its ipmi plugin, 
  but currently there are blocking bugs open (see latest date below).
  02/11/04 OpenHPI 0.5 dies during discovery
  05/24/04 OpenHPI 1.0.0 testing, wrote more bugzillas
  10/14/04 openhpi-1.9.1 testing, then added alarm panel code
      With patches to 1.9.1, alarm panel controls are operational now.
  12/02/04 Submitted fixes for watchdog 932510 & 1077934.
  01/10/05 Submitted fixes for several inventory bugs into openhpi-2.0.1 cvs.
