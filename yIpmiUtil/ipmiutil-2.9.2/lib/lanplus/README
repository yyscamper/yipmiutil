ipmitool/plugins/lanplus for ipmiutil

lib/lanplus directory

This contains the lanplus plugin source from the ipmitool project, 
which supports IPMI LAN 2.0 RMCP+ protocol.  
This is a slightly modified version from ipmitool-1.8.8.90 with changes
to link better with ipmiutil and changes for WIN32.

See http://ipmitool.sourceforge.net for the latest version of lanplus,
then apply the iutil.diff patch to make it compatible with ipmiutil.

This builds a lanplus library that is used by ipmiutil, along with 
the crypto libraries from openssl (see openssl.org). 

The util/ipmilanplus.c code in ipmiutil calls the lanplus routines,
if the HAVE_LANPLUS compile flag is defined.
