# This script runs ipmiutil sel, writing any new records to syslog, 
# and will then clear the SEL if free space is low.
#
# The IPMI SEL should not normally be cleared, because the history
# of the events is important, but if the IPMI SEL fills up, no new
# events are logged, so saving the previous SEL events and clearing
# the SEL must be done occasionally, as needed.
